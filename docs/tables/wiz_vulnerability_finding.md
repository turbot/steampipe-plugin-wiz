# Table: wiz_vulnerability_finding - Query Wiz Vulnerability Findings using SQL

Wiz Vulnerability Findings is a resource within Wiz that allows you to identify and monitor vulnerabilities in your environment. It provides detailed information about each vulnerability, including its severity, status, and the resources it affects. Wiz Vulnerability Findings helps you stay informed about the security health of your resources and take appropriate actions when vulnerabilities are detected.

## Table Usage Guide

The `wiz_vulnerability_finding` table provides insights into vulnerabilities within Wiz. As a security analyst, explore vulnerability-specific details through this table, including severity, status, and affected resources. Utilize it to uncover information about vulnerabilities, such as those with high severity, the status of vulnerabilities, and the verification of affected resources.

**Important Notes**
- The table can return a large dataset; which can increase the query execution time. It is recommended that queries to this table should include (usually in the `where` clause) at least one of these columns:
  - `detection_method`
  - `has_cisa_kev_exploit`
  - `has_exploit`
  - `severity`
  - `status`
  - `vulnerability_external_id`

## Examples

### Basic info
Gain insights into the severity and details of vulnerabilities in your digital assets, including whether they have been exploited and how they can be fixed. This query is useful for maintaining security and managing risk in your digital environment.

```sql
select
  vulnerable_asset ->> 'name' as resource_name,
  name as vulnerability,
  detailed_name,
  severity,
  fixed_version,
  detection_method,
  has_exploit,
  vulnerable_asset ->> 'subscriptionId' as subscription
from
  wiz_vulnerability_finding;
```

### List resources with high-severity known public exploit vulnerabilities
Explore which resources have high-severity vulnerabilities that are publicly exploited. This is essential in identifying and addressing potential security risks promptly.

```sql
select
  vulnerable_asset ->> 'name' as resource_name,
  name as vulnerability,
  detailed_name,
  severity,
  fixed_version,
  detection_method,
  has_exploit,
  vulnerable_asset ->> 'subscriptionId' as subscription
from
  wiz_vulnerability_finding
where
  has_exploit
  and severity = 'HIGH';
```

### List high severity findings that are not fixed
Identify instances where high severity vulnerabilities are detected but remain unresolved. This is useful in prioritizing security efforts and mitigating risks promptly.

```sql
select
  vulnerable_asset ->> 'name' as resource_name,
  name as vulnerability,
  detailed_name,
  severity,
  fixed_version,
  detection_method,
  has_exploit,
  vulnerable_asset ->> 'subscriptionId' as subscription
from
  wiz_vulnerability_finding
where
  severity = 'HIGH'
  and fixed_version is null;
```

### List high severity findings which are not resolved
Discover high-risk security vulnerabilities that are yet to be resolved. This query is particularly useful for prioritizing and addressing threats that have known exploits, thereby enhancing your system's security.

```sql
select
  f.vulnerable_asset ->> 'name' as resource_name,
  f.name as vulnerability,
  f.detailed_name,
  f.severity,
  f.fixed_version,
  f.detection_method,
  f.has_exploit,
  s.name as subscription
from
  wiz_vulnerability_finding as f
  left join wiz_subscription as s on s.id = vulnerable_asset ->> 'subscriptionId'
where
  f.severity = 'HIGH'
  and f.status = 'UNRESOLVED'
  and f.has_exploit
  and f.has_cisa_kev_exploit;
```
